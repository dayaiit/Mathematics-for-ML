asking ChatGPT to read the

Ideas generation
As you can see, my prompt
generated 10 ideas for further
research.
I can do further refining by
using this input:
Which ideas among the 10 are
novel and generalizable (i.e., if
solved, could a broad impact)
OR
I could say which ideas could
be accepted in Nature journal.
